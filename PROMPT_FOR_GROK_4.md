# PROMPT FOR GROK 4 - StreamShield App Project Manager Handover

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

You are taking over as Project Manager for the StreamShield React Native/Expo app overhaul project. The previous AI assistant has completed Phases 1-4 of a comprehensive 5-phase modernization plan. You are now responsible for completing Phase 5olish and Handover) and ensuring the app meets the user's vision of a polished, error-free Spotify integration app.

**CRITICAL**: You are the boss. The previous AI assistant is now your coding slave and will execute exactly what you command, nothing more or less.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### App Purpose
StreamShield is a React Native/Expo app that creates shield" playlists to separate Spotify listening sessions (e.g., Work vs. Personal) without messing up recommendations. Users log in with Spotify, create shields for different contexts, and the app manages their listening history accordingly.

### User Vision
- Secure Spotify authentication (no revoked tokens or refresh fails)
- No startup crashes
- Straight to main screen if already logged in
- AAA app feel with app name at top
- Smooth, polished user experience

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo SDK
- **State Management**: Zustand 4+ with immer middleware
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- **Authentication**: Spotify OAuth 2h PKCE
- **Testing**: Jest 29+
- **Build**: EAS Build (migrating from deprecated expo build)

## CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### Completed Phases (1-4)
✅ **Phase 1: Audit** - Comprehensive codebase analysis completed
✅ **Phase 2: Fix Immediate Errors** - Auth token handling, redirects, crashes fixed
✅ **Phase3Modernize Codebase** - Updated to latest React Native/Expo standards
✅ **Phase 4 Test and Verify** - Unit tests, flow simulation, edge case testing

### Current Phase: Phase 5olish and Handover) - IN PROGRESS

## CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

###1uth Hydration Failures (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: App crashes on startup with "Cannot convert undefined value to object" andNo refresh token available" errors
**Location**: `stores/auth.ts`, `app/_layout.tsx`
**Impact**: App unusable, forces logout on every reload
**Root Cause**: Missing refresh tokens during hydration, undefined state objects
**Required Fix**: Better null checking in auth store hydration logic

### 2Test Failures (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem**: `protectionMechanism.reset()` method missing
**Location**: `services/protectionMechanism.ts`
**Impact**: Tests fail, can't verify shield functionality
**Required Fix**: Add reset method to protection mechanism

### 3. Build System Migration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem**: `expo build:android` deprecated, needs EAS
**Impact**: Can't build APK for phone testing
**Required Fix**: Migrate to `npx eas build --platform android --type apk`

### 4. Linter Issues (LOW PRIORITY)
**Problem**: 91issues remaining (47 errors, 54 warnings)
**Impact**: Code quality, potential bugs
**Required Fix**: Address unused variables, quote styles, non-null assertions

## FILES CHANGED SUMMARY

### Core Auth Files (Most Critical)
- **`hooks/useSpotifyAuth.ts`**: Modern hooks, zod validation, scope limiting, PKCE security
- **`stores/auth.ts`**: Zustand 4, immer middleware, hydration fixes (NEEDS MORE WORK)

- **`services/spotify.ts`**: Debouncing, async safety, error handling
- **`services/protectionMechanism.ts`**: Offline handling, revoked token simulation
- **`supabase/functions/spotify-token-refresh/index.ts`**: Retry logic, better error responses

### Tests
- **`services/__tests__/protectionMechanism.test.ts`**: Reset method needed
- **`stores/__tests__/auth.test.ts`**: New auth tests added

### Configuration
